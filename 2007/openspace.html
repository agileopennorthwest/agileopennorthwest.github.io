<h3>About Open Space</h3>

<p>Back in 1983, Harrison Owen made a discovery. He had spent a year organizing
an international conference and, when it was over, everyone agreed that the best
learning, information sharing and networking had occured in the coffee breaks!</p>

<p>Owen went on to originate Open Space Technology, an approach to organizing meetings
that allows groups of all sizes to self-organize, create an agenda and solve complex 
problems. Agile Open Northwest is based on Open Space Technology.</p>

<p>Over the last 20 or more years, the Open Space movement has grown to the point 
where entire conferences based on its principles are not uncommon.  Working without 
an agenda, but with specific strategies to encourage and direct participation, 
groups of up to 1000 people have successfully self-organized around a complex 
problem, held meetings and published results.</p>

<p>OST is particularly appropriate for an Agile conference, because it delays 
all decisions about what sessions will be held, when they will be scheduled
and who will attend them until the last responsible moment. If you have ever
signed up for particular sessions in a traditional conference months in advance,
only to discover that your needs and interests had changed by the time you
got to the event, you'll appreciate the value of this!</p>

<h4>Opening Space</h4>
<p>The opening session of Agile Open Northwest takes place on the first morning
with everyone attending. At that time, the principles of Open Space will be explained 
and you will have a chance to ask questions about them.</p>

<blockquote style="background: #C0C0A0; border: 1px black solid">
<h4 style="text-align: center">The Four Principles</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Whoever comes is the right people.
  <li>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.
  <li>Whenever it starts is the right time.
  <li>Whenever its over, its over.
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h4>Creating a Session</h4>
<p>After this introduction, we will invite those who want to host a session 
to come forward and present it. This is a simple process. No papers, slides, 
flip-charts are needed - or even desired. You will simply step forward and talk 
to us about the session you are proposing. You should include just enough 
information to let people decide whether to attend - and no more. Generally,
less than one minute is needed. </p>

<p>After presenting a summary of your proposed session, you will select a time
and place from those available on our wall-display and post a notice there.</p>

<h4>Attending Sessions</h4>
<p>It's important for everyone attending our conference to be present for the 
opening. You should listen to the presentations and take note of those you would 
like to attend. As you listen, you may be inspired to present a session yourself. 
There are no deadlines or time limits: simply step up and describe your idea 
for a session.</p> 

<p>At the end of the presentation, you will be invited to browse the notices on the 
wall and sign up to attend any sessions that interest you. Signing up for a session 
is optional. You may attend any session you like and even move between sessions.</p>

<h4>Adding Sessions</h4>
<p>You may add a sesson to the schedule at any time during the event by posting
information about it in an available slot. We'll have periodic announcements
of any new or rescheduled sessions as well, but it's a good idea for all
participants to keep an eye out for schedule changes.</p>
