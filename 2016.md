    I love being with people that find joy in their job. I spend most of my time helping people see the forest for the trees and sometimes just looking at the trees in the forest.

    My background ranges from lean six sigma, different kinds of management including project and people, to facilitator, scrum master, and coach. I love learning from people everyday. My passion is to help others learn to learn. I use interactive group facilitation skills to create space for conversations and dialogue.

<h2 id="location">Location &amp; Map</h2>

Created for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, Seattle Center calls itself "the nation's best gathering place." It certainly has a lot to offer, including cultural venues, sports arenas, entertainment options, the Science Center, and a Food Court, in addition to beautiful grounds. It is easily accessible by car, bus or riding the monorail from downtown Seattle.

This year we'll be in the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall, located at 299 Mercer Street and directly across from the convenient Seattle Center parking facility. There are numerous spots nearby for impromptu gatherings, including a McMenamin's pub for you Oregonians. For your dinner choices, a number of restaurants are within walking distance.

### Hotel Information

For out-of-towners, we are currently have arrangements with the local hotels below for special rates.

#### Pensione Nichols

![](/img/hotels/pensione_nichols.jpg)

1923 First avenue \\
Seattle WA 98101 \\
Phone: 206.441.7125 \\
E-Mail: info@pensionenichols.com \\
[http://pensionenichols.com/](http://pensionenichols.com/)

Our conference rate is $89 per night; parking is extra.  Put “Agile Conference” in the notes when you register online or tell them you are registering
for the Agile conference if you reserve by phone.

This is a small bed and breakfast hotel, but for this rate they are not serving breakfast. We are providing breakfast at the conference.

This B&B hotel has a large, glorious English country shabby chic common room on the third floor with a glorious view of the sound where you can take
your bottle of wine and talk all night. The hotel backs up against the Public Market. We negotiated a no-breakfast rate since we are providing
breakfast at the conference, and the hotel doesn’t start serving until 8:00 AM. Be prepared for a couple of long flights of stairs and no elevators,
but the location and the view are worth it. The hotel is nine blocks from the Seattle Center and three blocks from the monorail.
