<h2 id="location">Location &amp; Map</h2>

Created for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, Seattle Center calls itself "the nation's best gathering place." It certainly has a lot to offer, including cultural venues, sports arenas, entertainment options, the Science Center, and a Food Court, in addition to beautiful grounds. It is easily accessible by car, bus or riding the monorail from downtown Seattle.

This year we'll be in the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall, located at 299 Mercer Street and directly across from the convenient Seattle Center parking facility. There are numerous spots nearby for impromptu gatherings, including a McMenamin's pub for you Oregonians. For your dinner choices, a number of restaurants are within walking distance.

### Hotel Information

For out-of-towners, we have made arrangements with the following hotels in near the center for a special rate.

#### Pensione Nichols

1923 1st Ave  
E-Mail: info@pensionenichols.com  
http://pensionenichols.com/  
Phone: 206-441-7125  

Put “AGILE” in the notes when you register online or tell them you are registering for the agile conference if you reserve by phone.

Our conference rate is $80 per night; parking is $14 per 24 hours.

This is a small bed and breakfast hotel, but for this rate they are not serving breakfast. We are providing breakfast at the conference.

Notes on Pensione Nichols: This B&B hotel has a large, glorious English country shabby chic common room on the third floor with a glorious view of the sound where you can take your bottle of wine and talk all night. The hotel backed up against the Public Market. We negotiated a no-breakfast rate since we are providing breakfast at the conference, and the hotel doesn't start serving until 8a. Be prepared for a couple of long flights of stairs and no elevators, but the location and the view are worth it. The hotel is nine blocks from the Seattle Center and three blocks from the monorail.

#### Mediterranean Inn

425 Queen Anne Avenue North  
http://www.mediterranean-inn.com/  
Phone: 206-428-4700 or 866-525-4700  

We have a conference rate of $79/night for single queens (100% non-smoking, and all with kitchenettes), net and non-commission-able (no third party bookings eligible). Ask for the AONW conference discount if calling in or use AONW as your discount code on the web site. NOTE: The online discount code may not be available until late on 1/13 due to technical difficulties . . .

Parking is $10/night. Both are valid from Feb 3rd to Feb 8th, any number of nights. Upgrades to Kings or Double/Doubles will be an additional $10/night, limited only by availability (all the above is limited by availability).

This is a recently updated and refreshed older hotel right next to Seattle Center.

Additional accomodations are available at several hotels close to the Center or in the Seattle downtown area. Additional parking is also available in the area.

There are numerous hotels available close to the Center and in the nearby Seattle downtown area. Watch this page for news of special rates for Agile Open Northwest attendees.
