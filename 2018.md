  bio: |
    I’m a part of the Northwest Software Craftsmanship, DevOps, Product, and Agile communities, and an 8+ year AONW attendee.  I’ve received so much from them that I’ve focused on giving through volunteering and hosting within my company and externally. Internally through things like Hackathons, Multi-Team Planning, Open Spaces, Open Demos, Meetups, and Curation. Externally through [this conference](/2018), [DevOpsDays Seattle](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-seattle/welcome/), [BeyondAgile](https://www.meetup.com/BeyondAgile/), [Seattle Scaled Agile](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Scaled-Agile-Community/), and [CodeRetreat](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-day-of-code-retreat-2017-seattle-tickets-35919614534). Topics on my mind these days are things like Scale and Systems Thinking, Social and Software System Dynamics, The evolving ways we communicate, Bottlenecks \| Betrayals \| Trust \| Safety \| Chaos \| Flow \| Agility \| Improvement \| Responsibility; at their many scales like Individual \| Role \| Teams \| Leadership \| Software \| Systems \| Infrastructure \| Products \| Planning \| Business \| Companies \| Culture \| Communities \| etc.

    Excited to help create another event that seeks to add value, and grateful to be involved.  My goals for this event are for you to leave with new energy, ideas, examples, and a better sense of where Northwest companies and practitioners are with these topics.

<h2 id="location">Location &amp; Map</h2>

Created for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, Seattle Center calls itself "the nation's best gathering place." It certainly has a lot to offer, including cultural venues, sports arenas, entertainment options, the Science Center, and a Food Court, in addition to beautiful grounds. It is easily accessible by car, bus or riding the monorail from downtown Seattle.

This year we'll be in the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall, located at 299 Mercer Street and directly across from the convenient Seattle Center parking facility. There are numerous spots nearby for impromptu gatherings, including a McMenamin's pub for you Oregonians. For your dinner choices, a number of restaurants are within walking distance.

### Hotel Information

For out-of-towners, here are a few local hotels we've worked with in the past. We are currently arranging special rates at nearby hotels (these or others) and will post
here when the information is available.

#### Pensione Nichols

![](/img/hotels/pensione_nichols.jpg)

1923 First avenue \\
Seattle WA 98101 \\
Phone: 206.441.7125 \\
E-Mail: info@pensionenichols.com \\
[http://pensionenichols.com/](http://pensionenichols.com/)

This is a small bed and breakfast hotel, but note that we are providing breakfast at the conference.

This B&B hotel has a large, glorious English country shabby chic common room on the third floor with a glorious view of the sound where you can take
your bottle of wine and talk all night. The hotel backs up against the Public Market. We negotiated a no-breakfast rate since we are providing
breakfast at the conference, and the hotel doesn’t start serving until 8:00 AM. Be prepared for a couple of long flights of stairs and no elevators,
but the location and the view are worth it. The hotel is nine blocks from the Seattle Center and three blocks from the monorail.
