<p id="title">Conference Location</p>
		
<p>Ambridge Event Center is a premier facility conveniently located in the 
heart of Portland's vibrant Lloyd District, the epicenter of The Rose City's 
special events. Grown in the tradition of hospitality for which the Northwest 
is famous, Ambridge Event Center takes its name and strength from a perfect, 
old-fashioned rose that thrives in Portland

<p>We will meet in Ambridge's new facility in the remodeled former Holy Rosary 
Community Center, only blocks from the Oregon Convention Center and the Max line. 
We've reserved a number of rooms, all within close proximity of the agenda wall 
for easy reference. In addition to the meeting rooms, we'll have a dedicated 
space for registration, meals, breaks, and sponsor exhibits. In addition, 
there are numerous spots nearby for impromptu gatherings. For your dinner 
choices, a number of restaurants are within walking distance.

<p>For out-of-towners, we have found a facility within walking distance of 
many hotels across the price range. Accommodations are available at several 
hotels close to the Ambridge Event Center, the nearby Convention Center, or in 
the Portland downtown area, a few short Max stops away in Fareless Square.
