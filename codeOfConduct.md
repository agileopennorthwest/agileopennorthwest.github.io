<h1>Agile Open Northwest Code of Conduct</h1>

_7 February 2017 version_

Agile Open Northwest supports the open exchange of ideas and freedom of thought and expression. Therefore, we want to create safe 
spaces, and we do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All AONW meetings and events exhibit a spirit of welcome. We meet in a friendly, safe environment. We expect all participants to show 
respect and courtesy to other participants, while engaging in civil discussion and debate. We expect you will speak up if 
disrespectful or discourteous behavior occurs.

To make clear what is expected, we have published this Code of Conduct. It is not exhaustive. Instead, we draw on the atmosphere of 
cooperation and transparency characteristic of our agile community. We expect all participants will honor this Code, and we'll 
continue to treat fellow community members honorably and with respect.

<h3>What to Do</h3>
If you are being harassed, experience unwelcome behavior, or have any other concerns, feel free to contact one of the organizers 
(see list below). If you see someone else being subjected to unwelcome or disparaging behavior, we ask you to recognize and name it, 
and contact an organizer. 

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist 
those experiencing harassment. We will work with you to decide on any steps to be taken. 

We value everyone’s attendance and want every participant to feel safe for the duration of the conference. Should you need a private 
discussion with an organizer about a specific problem at any event or gathering, please contact one of the following people:

* AONW Board President
* Any Board Member
* Conference Co-Chairs

<h3>If You Need the Details</h3>
Agile Open Northwest dedicates our efforts to providing a safe, harassment-free experience for everyone. Our events create an 
environment that: 

* Recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group
* Fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect
* Embraces diversity–regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, race, disability, body size, physical appearance, cognitive capacity, or other innate trait
* Respects religious freedoms and deeply held beliefs

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

As a community, we will not endure insults or attacks on the other parties in any discussion. These modes of discourse do not 
contribute to the healthy exchange of ideas, and we consider them inappropriate. Sexualized language and imagery have no place in any 
part of the conference. 

<h3>If You Need More Details</h3>
If another participant (whether target or bystander) asks you to stop any unwelcome or harassing behavior, we expect you to comply 
immediately.

Unwelcome behavior or harassment includes, but is not limited to: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, 
race, religion, disability or physical appearance; display of sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking or 
following of participants; sustained disruption of open space sessions or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome 
sexual attention. 

If a conference participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, 
including offering feedback on behavior, warning the offender, or expelling the offender from the conference with no refund. We may 
sanction or expel without a refund any conference participant (including paid registrants, sponsors, volunteer staff, and organizers) 
who violates these rules, at the discretion of the conference organizers.
