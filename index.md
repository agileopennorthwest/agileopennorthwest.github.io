<p>Agile Open Northwest is proud to present our {{page.anniversary}} Annual AONW conference 
on {{page.date}} {{page.date-modifier}}<!--at the {{page.venue}} in {{page.citystate}}-->. 
The theme this year is "{{page.theme}}." We are dedicated to a low-cost conference, and are pleased to hold the rate to only

This will be a virtual Open Space event, held over the course of 3 days, lasting 4 hours each day. Over the last several months, there's

AONW is an annual conference about agile practices and techniques. Using [Open Space](#about_open_space), the participants themselves
make the conference they want to attend. Come prepared to share your latest ideas, challenges, hopes, experiences and experiments! Inclusive but intimate,
Agile Open Northwest is limited to less than {{ page.attendees }} participants.

In addition to hosting our annual February conference about agile practices and techniques, Agile Open Northwest sponsors and hosts other events that
focus on agile topics, use Open Space, and occur in the Northwest United States. As soon as the next one is scheduled we will announce it here,
and on <a href="http://twitter.com/aonw">Twitter</a>.
<!--One of these recently finished! {{ site.last-other-event-fullname }} was 
a one-day event held on Friday, September 16th, 2016 at the AXIS Pioneer Square in Seattle. You can find more details about the event, including the 
session notes, [here]({{ site.last-other-event-url }}).
