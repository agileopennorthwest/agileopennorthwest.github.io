Agile Open Northwest is an annual conference about agile practices and techniques. Using [Open Space](#about_open_space), the participants themselves
make the conference they want to attend. Come prepared to share your latest ideas, challenges, hopes, experiences and experiments! Inclusive but intimate,
Agile Open Northwest is limited to less than 300 participants.

In addition to hosting our annual February conference about agile practices and techniques, Agile Open Northwest sponsors and hosts other events that
focus on agile topics, use Open Space, and occur in the Northwest United States. One of these recently finished! {{ site.last-other-event-fullname }} was 
a one-day event held on Friday, September 16th, 2016 at the AXIS Pioneer Square in Seattle. You can find more details about the event, including the session notes, [here]({{ site.last-other-event-url }}).
