<!--
Agile Open Northwest is an annual conference about agile practices and techniques. Using [Open Space](#about_open_space), the participants themselves make the conference they want to attend. Come prepared to share your latest ideas, challenges, hopes, experiences and experiments! Inclusive but intimate, Agile Open Northwest is limited to only 200 participants.
-->
In addition to hosting our annual February conference about agile practices and techniques, Agile Open Northwest sponsors and hosts other events that focus on agile topics, use Open Space, and occur in the Northwest United States. One of these is just around the corner!
