<p>Agile Open Northwest is proud to present our {{page.anniversary}} Annual AONW conference 
on {{page.date}} {{page.date-modifier}}<!--at the {{page.venue}} in {{page.citystate}}-->. 
The theme this year is "{{page.theme}}." We are dedicated to a low-cost conference, and are pleased to hold the rate to only 
${{page.cost}} (plus {{page.reg-service}} fees) for the 3-day event. 
</p>
<p>
This will be a virtual Open Space event, held over the course of 3 days, lasting 4 hours each day. Over the last year there has 
been a great blossoming of tools and techniques 
for online events. We are excited to bring together the best of the best to make this an inclusive, engaging, and valuable event 
for all our old friends, and for those new to AONW.
</p>
{% else %}
<p>
Agile Open Northwest is excited to present our New Agile Open Camp 1-day event on September 9th, 2022 â€“ our first live event since 2020! 
Agile Open Camp 2022 is for all collaborative agile practitioners and learners, including developers, testers, designers, managers, 
product owners, and more. Our conference provides a place to have conversations, share stories, and explore new ideas. Working with specific 
strategies to encourage and direct participation, groups have successfully self-organized around complex problems, held meetings, and published 
results. 
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that in early 2023 we will again hold our 3-day virtual event.  We are looking to expand to 2 events a year!
</p>
<p>
Due to ongoing concerns around COVID-19, we have found a very large space to hold our event, Hangar 30 at Magnuson Park in Seattle.  We will be 
opening the doors on both sides to allow full airflow to minimize Covid risks, weather dependent.    It holds roughly 1300 people and we will be 
inviting just a 125-150 or so attendees.

AONW is an annual conference about agile practices and techniques. Using [Open Space](#about_open_space), the participants themselves
make the conference they want to attend. Come prepared to share your latest ideas, challenges, hopes, experiences and experiments! Inclusive but intimate,
Agile Open Northwest is limited to less than {{ page.attendees }} participants.
