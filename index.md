AONW is an annual conference about agile practices and techniques. Using [Open Space](#about_open_space), the participants themselves
make the conference they want to attend. Come prepared to share your latest ideas, challenges, hopes, experiences and experiments! Inclusive but intimate,
Agile Open Northwest is limited to less than 300 participants.
