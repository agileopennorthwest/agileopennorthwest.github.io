	  WSA was established in 1995 as a "boutique" provider of software development 
	  consulting and training services. Since our inception we have helped teams 
	  over North America and Europe become great at producing software. We believe 
	  the best people to solve your problems are you own people. Our approach to 
	  a consulting engagement is to work collaboratively with your staff to develop 
	  a solution strategy. After all it's  your company, not ours. We provide them 
	  with the skills, tools, awareness, and confidence to create, and evolve a 
	  sustainable solution. In our opinion, the highest performing teams consist of 
	  socially connected people who can effectively communicate their expertise 
	  efficiently and work together.
