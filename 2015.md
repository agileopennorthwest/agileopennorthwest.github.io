  bio: |
    I am intrigued by the possibility of a world of (non-software) teams who understand the power of being agile, and have tools to help get them there. When I started my own company 12 years ago, I gave myself the gift to study anything that piqued my curiosity.  That gift led to my exposure to agile principles and frameworks, human systems dynamics, servant and facilitative leadership concepts, importance of retrospectives, facilitation methods, and Lean.  I help teams from municipalities and state organizations, universities, and businesses achieve big dreams and manage complex projects using these principles and tools. Many of these teams consist of engineers, planners, regulators, researchers, and others who may have otherwise never heard of agile.  Check out what is happening outside of software on the LinkedIn site [Agile Project Management (non-software)](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Agile-Project-Management-nonsoftware-4744676/about "Agile Project Management (non-software)"). 
    
    You can find the business me at [Lanier-Consulting.com](http://Lanier-Consulting.com "Lanier Consulting").  If I am not working, I am doing one of the following: hugging and loving my family and friends, kissing baby bellies, running bare foot across a plowed field, sitting quietly in a swamp listening to woodpeckers, running fully clothed into the ocean, climbing trees, taking long walks in the mountains, or letting the cold rain of a thunderstorm hit my face
