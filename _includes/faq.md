Who can create an Open Space session?
: Anyone attending Agile Open Northwest may create a session.

What topics are suitable for an Open Space session?
: Any topic related to our conference theme is appropriate. Sessions may be on technical or non-technical subjects, but should relate to working with agile methods in the real world.

Do I have to be an expert in the topic to host a session?
: No, session conveners only need to have the level of expertise needed to conduct the session. If you intend to teach other people about something, we hope you actually know something about it. But you may choose to conduct your session as a discussion among peers or even organize a session around a topic that you know little about but would like to understand better. Be sure to explain how you intend to conduct the session when you invite people to attend it.

Can I add a session after the Opening?
: Yes, just speak to one of the hosts. We will have announcements of new sessions and changes at the start of each day and during lunch.

Will there be a record of sessions?
: We publish simultaneously with the conference an online record of what sessions were held, who participated and what happened in them. The level of detail of this summary is up to the session hosts; at the conference, instructions and assistance will be available so that you can enter session information while it is fresh.

Can we schedule sessions in the evening?
: We have optional night-owl sessions on the schedule in the evenings. We must leave the facility before closing time... but
wherever it happens is the right place, so you can schedule sessions in other places like coffee shops, restaurants, or bars. Use your imagination. :-)
We also have early bird sessions at 8:00 am for those who prefer the bright light of morning.

Are meals provided?
: We'll have a continental breakfast and lunches each day at the venue. Occasionally there is a sponsored dinner. There are also a number of restaurants within easy walking distance.

Are accommodations available?
: There are a number of hotels nearby. At the time of this writing, we are working on arranging special rates at nearby hotels. See the [Location](/{{site.years[0]}}#location) section and follow [our tweets](http://twitter.com/aonw) for more info.

What equipment is provided for the sessions?
: All the rooms will have easels with flip-chart tablets, markers, and some sticky notes.

Will we have Internet access?
: Yes, wireless Internet access will be available.

How do you set the registration price each year?
: We try to keep the cost of registration as low as we can, so that attendees can pay their own way if they must. Prices for suitable venues and food change every year, and have risen in recent years. We're grateful that our sponsors help keep registration prices low.

Why doesn't AONW offer refunds?
: In recent years, AONW has sold out, often well in advance of the event.
We emphasize our no-refunds policy because each year, we receive multiple requests for refunds from registrants who maintain they didn’t know we have such a policy.
Why do we have the policy? We’re a non-profit with limited financial resources, and we have to pay over $65,000 in fixed and non-refundable expenses, mostly well in advance of when the event occurs.
Without the money our early registrants provide, AONW would be impossible. The requests for refunds tend to come in the last few weeks before the event, after we've already booked caterers and don't have an ability to adjust...and most those on the waiting list are no longer able to change their plans to attend in the place of someone seeking a refund.
All this means that we won’t be able to offer a refund or a transfer to another event. You can substitute a different attendee at any time up to the start of the event. See "How do I substitute a different attendee?"
AONW has for years now had a no-refunds policy. The policy is presented in Eventbrite during the purchase stream, in the email purchase confirmation, and on the electronic or paper registration itself. Having said that, nearly no one notices the policy. We wish we could figure out how to make this even clearer, so we've added notices of the policy even more places, and created this FAQ answer.

How do I substitute a different attendee on my registration?
: For help with this, please contact AONW Registration [registration@AgileOpenNorthwest.org](mailto:registration@AgileOpenNorthwest.org).

<!--
: To substitute a different attendee on the Eventbrite site, all you need to do is log in to the Eventbrite account you used to purchase the registration, then change the attendee name, email address, and company name to the new attendee. We'd also appreciate having the new attendee answer all the questions we ask.
Here's some help on doing that: 
[howToTransferTickets](https://www.eventbrite.com/support/articles/en_US/Q_A/how-to-transfer-tickets-to-someone-else?lg=en_US).
There's even a tutorial with pictures that might help make this easy. Forgot your login info? The article helps with that, too!
What that ends up doing is changing the information that matters for registration - the name on the badge, the survey questions, address, and so on.
If you're still having trouble, contact AONW Registration [registration@AgileOpenNorthwest.org](mailto:registration@AgileOpenNorthwest.org).
