Who can create an Open Space session?
: Anyone attending Agile Open Northwest may create a session.

What topics are suitable for an Open Space session?
: Any topic related to our conference theme is appropriate. Sessions may be on technical or non-technical subjects, but should relate to working with agile methods in the real world.

Do I have to be an expert in the topic to host a session?
: No, session conveners only need to have the level of expertise needed to conduct the session. If you intend to teach other people about something, we hope you actually know something about it. But you may choose to conduct your session as a discussion among peers or even organize a session around a topic that you know little about but would like to understand better. Be sure to explain how you intend to conduct the session when you invite people to attend it.

Can I add a session after the Opening?
: Yes, just speak to one of the hosts. We will have announcements of new sessions and changes at the start of each day and during lunch.

Will there be a record of sessions?
: We publish simultaneously with the conference an online record of what sessions were held, who participated and what happened in them. The level of detail of this summary is up to the session hosts; at the conference, instructions and assistance will be available so that you can enter session information while it is fresh.

Can we schedule sessions in the evening?
: We have optional night-owl sessions on the schedule on Wednesday and Thursday evenings. We must leave the facility before closing time... but wherever it happens is the right place, so you can schedule sessions in other places like coffee shops, restaurants, or bars. Use your imagination. :-)
We also have early bird sessions at 8:00 am on Thursday and Friday for those who prefer the bright light of morning.

Are meals provided?
: We'll have a continental breakfast and lunches each day, and dinner on Thursday evening. For dinner on Wednesday, there are a number of restaurants within easy walking distance.

Are accommodations available?
: There are a number of hotels nearby. At the time of this writing, we are working on arranging special rates at nearby hotels. See the [Location](/{{site.years[0]}}#location) section and follow [our tweets](http://twitter.com/aonw) for more info.

What equipment is provided for the sessions?
: All the rooms will have easels with flip-chart tablets, markers, and some sticky notes.

Will we have Internet access?
: Yes, wireless Internet access will be available.

Why did we add a third day?
: The first half-dozen AONW two-day conferences were packed with sessions and filled to the limit. Your hosts felt that adding a third day would be a chance to broaden the community. It turns out that when you have *two* nights to sleep on something, the magic really begins to happen the third day...and so we expect new sessions to be added that morning that grow out of what happened the first two days. Past attendees can tell you that some of the most interesting discoveries happen during dinner, and now there are two opportunities for that. And lastly, we've found having a retrospective on the conference afterwards provides us with the best ideas for next year...and now you can join us in contributing to that learning.

How do you set the registration price each year?
: We try to keep the cost of registration as low as we can, so that attendees can pay their own way if they must. Prices for suitable venues and food change every year, and have risen in recent years. We're grateful that our sponsors help keep registration prices low.

Why does AONW have a no-refunds policy?
: When we hold AONW these days, we often sell out, and well in advance of the event. That gives us some flexibility in accommodating those who missed out on snagging a registration and those for whom circumstances turn out to be different than expected.

: We emphasize our no-refunds policy because each year, we receive multiple requests for refunds from registrants who maintain they didn’t know we have such a policy. We’re a non-profit with limited financial resources, and we have to pay over $60,000 in fixed and non-refundable expenses, mostly well in advance of when the event occurs.

: Without the money our early registrants provide, AONW would be impossible. The requests for refunds tend to come in the last few weeks before the event, long vafter we've already booked caterers and venue and don't have an ability to adjust...and those on the waiting list often no longer are able to change their plans to attend in the place of someone seeking a refund.

Can I transfer my registration to someone on the waiting list?

: We *will* offer your registration to the waiting list if you ask us, but if no one purchases a registration to balance yours, we won’t be able to offer a refund. If you receive a refund notice, you’ll know you were one of the lucky ones.

Can I transfer my registration to next year's conference?

: No. Each conference and event has different budgets and constraints.

How do I transfer my purchased registration to another attendees?
: Log in to your Eventbrite account using the information you provided when your registration was purchased. Change the attendee name, email address, and company name to the new attendee. We really appreciate it when the new attendee re-answers the survey questions. 

That didn't work. What do I do now?

*That* didn't work. Help!
