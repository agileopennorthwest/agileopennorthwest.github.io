- name: Nora Beyerle
  img: nora.jpeg
  bio: |
    I journeyed into technology via a music education. Working in the software industry since 2000, I’ve explored responsibilities of business analysis, project management, and people management. It was the agile values and principles that resonated strongest with me, and I have since focused on coaching agile development teams and championing individuals. I appreciate all the learning opportunities within our agile community of practice! I enjoy volunteering at AgilePDX, and now joining Agile Open Northwest. Additionally I am looking forward to further collaborate with Future of Work communities. I believe that people can change the world, and that we can achieve this by being curious, open, and kind.

    I hesitantly tweet at @sunhiltb.

- name: Ron Quartel
  img: ron_quartel.jpg
  bio: |
    Ron will tell you his life purpose is to "unleash the human spirit in the workplace." He loves all things software and nurturing 
    business/development harmony in particular. 

    His agile and Extreme Programming journey started in 2002, and over the years he has 
    built strong technical skills and a deep understanding of agile methods. He has put these to good use in several roles during 
    his career: developer, development manager, and agile coach.

    In 2014 Ron had an epiphany about a new way of working. A way that makes self-organization inescapable rather than just paying 
    lip service to the concept. This method aligned with his vision and has been his passion ever since.

- name: Steve Kuo
  img: steve_kuo.jpg
  bio: |
    Steve accepted Agile and Extreme Programming (XP) into his professional career more years ago than he likes to count. 
    Although it took him a few years to get fully into all the disciplines, he’s a firm believer and staunch advocate for the 
    XP technical practices. Steve is most frequently embedded with a team helping them to become excellent. It’s also not uncommon 
    to see him helping friends, teaching classes, or attending conferences extolling the virtues of code craft, deliberate practice, 
    and collaborative working. He continues to run experiments discovering new ways to work and bring joy to the workplace.

- name: Willem Larsen

<h2 id="location">Location &amp; Map</h2>

Created for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, Seattle Center calls itself "the nation's best gathering place." It certainly has a lot to offer, including cultural venues, sports arenas, entertainment options, the Science Center, and a Food Court, in addition to beautiful grounds. It is easily accessible by car, bus or riding the monorail from downtown Seattle.

This year we'll be in the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall, located at 299 Mercer Street and directly across from the convenient Seattle Center parking facility. There are numerous spots nearby for impromptu gatherings, including a McMenamin's pub for you Oregonians. For your dinner choices, a number of restaurants are within walking distance.

### Directions

The **Seattle Center Exhibition Hall** is in the same building as the Pacific Northwest Ballet, on the lower level:
