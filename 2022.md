event-hosts:
- name: Alex Bernardin (he/him)
  img: alex.jpeg
  bio: |
    Alex is an Agilist who gets his kicks devising 'just enough' process solutions, and coaching/mentoring teams to be high performing 
    and self-organizing.
    
    He's been working with web development in one way or another since 1996, and is honored to be helping bring 
    together AONW for the second time.

- name: Kelly Austin, Ph.D.
  img: kelly.jpg
  bio: |
    Kelly loves agile, in part because manifestos are among the most interesting and peculiar of genres and in part because humans are both the hardest and the easiest to understand.
  
    She treats the process of humans making things with wonder and care and curiosity and rigor—whether they’re making poetry or software.
    
    Open Space helps her practice keeping her heart and eyes and mind wide open.

facilitator:
- name: Ashanti Gardner
  img: Ashanti_Gardner.jpg
  bio: |
    Ashanti Gardner is a visual scribe, artist/illustrator, and lifelong learner. As a visual scribe, she captures spoken conversation,

    creativity to discover new ideas and explore what is unknown to us.

hosts:
- name: Aki Namioka

- name: Ian Savage

His present interests are software security, insourcing vs. outsourcing, and quality training. Like many others, Ian looks forward to retirement or Career 2.0.
- name: Michaela Hutfles
  img: michaela.jpg
  bio: | 
    Michaela Hutfles is a sideways E-shaped person (rather than T) with three major depths: agile software development, earth-building and performing arts of all flavors. For a salary, they coach agile thinking and self-management to software developers and keep teams focused on continuous improvement, growth mindset, and general meta-cognition. At the moment they do this at Qumulo. They’re building a tiny house on the Olympic Peninsula using clay, straw, and sand. They dream of someday starting a tiny arts foundation called Dionysus Giving. Because it amuses them, Michaela often claims to raise champion naked mole rats.
- name: Nora Beyerle
  img: nora.jpeg
  bio: |
    I journeyed into technology via a music education. Working in the software industry since 2000, I’ve explored responsibilities of business analysis, project management, and people management. It was the agile values and principles that resonated strongest with me, and I have since focused on coaching agile development teams and championing individuals. I appreciate all the learning opportunities within our agile community of practice! I enjoy volunteering at AgilePDX, and now joining Agile Open Northwest. Additionally I am looking forward to further collaborate with Future of Work communities. I believe that people can change the world, and that we can achieve this by being curious, open, and kind.

    I hesitantly tweet at @sunhiltb.

      that develop software) to build great products that delight their customers and are built by engaged and happy teams. How do we do 
      this? We meet our customers where they are. Many organizations strive for that north star vision, but many have trouble getting 
      there. We start with aligning on what outcomes you’re trying to achieve and what problems you want to solve then use a variety of 
      tools to help them reach those. Our goal is to reignite the spirit of agility for all of our clients and the communities we’re 
      engaged with.  A “by the book” agile implementation often results in people checking boxes and not embracing a new mindset. 
      Agile and Scrum are great tools, but we draw on lots more, like Crucial Conversations, DISC profiles, Training from the Back of the 
      Room, Intentional Leadership, Design Thinking, and more. Let's light the fire of engagement and value together!

<h2 id="location">Location &amp; Map</h2>

Created for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, Seattle Center calls itself "the nation's best gathering place." It certainly has a lot to offer, including cultural venues, sports arenas, entertainment options, the Science Center, and a Food Court, in addition to beautiful grounds. It is easily accessible by car, bus or riding the monorail from downtown Seattle.

This year we'll be in the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall, located at 299 Mercer Street and directly across from the convenient Seattle Center parking facility. There are numerous spots nearby for impromptu gatherings, including a McMenamin's pub for you Oregonians. For your dinner choices, a number of restaurants are within walking distance.

### Directions

The **Seattle Center Exhibition Hall** is in the same building as the Pacific Northwest Ballet, on the lower level:
