  bio: | 
    Michaela Hutfles is a sideways E-shaped person (ather than T) with three major depths: agile software development, earth-building and performing arts of all flavors. For a salary, she coaches agile thinking and self-management to software developers and keeps teams focused on continuous improvement, growth mindset, and general meta-cognition. At the moment she does this at Amazon. She's building a tiny house on the Olympic Peninsula using clay, straw, and sand. She dreams of someday starting a tiny arts foundation called Dionysus Giving. Because it amuses her, Michaela often claims to raise champion naked mole rats.

  bio: |
    Andrew Rux left GE Healthcare in 2002 to go work for a start-up just beginning its agile journey. He had to transition from a formal checklist project manager to an adaptive product owner. In that time, he’s worked for several other start-ups converting ideas into products delivered to the healthcare market. His interests lie in combining a focus on the customer experience, being an exceptional product owner to his teams, while also being keen on how his teams get their work done. At present, he’s working on a new start-up that's just at the idea stage, while fostering a rescue dog named Flicka.

About the {{ page.year }} Conference in {{ page.city }}
------------------------------------------------------------

### THEME
 
Have we forgotten the FIRST line of the Agile Manifesto, "individuals and interactions over processes and tools?" Have the 12 principles been left behind? In the past 15 years since its signing, many teams have gone along to ride the agile wave and organically grow a mishmash of practices to declare themselves Agile. Meanwhile, the Agile movement has matured to see a plethora of best practices books, prescriptive scaling solutions, and multiple certifications; lots of HOW.

 * HOW can we put the WHY back into agile?
 * WHY is your team doing Agile?
 * WHAT did you hope to achieve with agile?
 * Did you, or are you still striving to achieving it?

So let's talk about HOW do we stop telling teams the HOW of Agile and start reminding them of WHY.

### WHERE IS IT?

The [Leftbank Annex](http://leftbankannex.com/) in lovely Portland, Oregon

### WHO SHOULD ATTEND?

### CAN I BE A SPONSOR?
