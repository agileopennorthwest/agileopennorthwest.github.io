Local setup
-----------

If you don't even have Ruby installed, see the full instructions for setting up a development environment 
on our wiki at [Development Environment](https://github.com/agileopennorthwest/agileopennorthwest.github.io/wiki/Development-Environment).
If you already have the correct version of Ruby installed (check the Gemfile for the version) then you can probably just 
get away with:
 
```
  bundle
  sudo npm install -g less
  npm install -g less-plugin-clean-css
```

Run locally
-----------

```
  make serve
```
