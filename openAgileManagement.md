### About the Event
The Open Agile Management Conference is for managers, executives and leaders who use agile practices and techniques to help organizations find a better way of working. This conference provides a place to have conversations with leading agile practitioners, share stories, and explore new ideas.

### About Our Format
We will be experimenting with a conference format derived from Harrison Owen’s Open Space Technology. In addition to the normal things you would expect to see at an “un-conference” you will also find some new ideas that we are incorporating into the experience:

A keynote speaker: We are very lucky to have Ray Arell, Founder and Principal Coach at nuCognitive, LLC giving our keynote. Ray will be sharing his experience as a manager coming to terms with what it means to be agile.

We will also be incorporating frequent reconvening to share ideas: In order to maximize the spread of ideas through the group, we will come together after each session to briefly share what we have learned.

### Creating a Session
After the keynote, we will invite those who want to convene a session to come forward and present it. It’s a simple process. You don’t need to prepare papers, slides, or flip-charts. You will simply step forward and briefly describe the session you propose. You’ll include just enough information to let people decide whether to attend…and no more. Generally, you need less than thirty seconds.

After presenting a summary of your proposed session, you’ll select a time and place and post a notice on our Marketplace wall. As each person does the same…Voila! The agenda is born.

We ask that everyone attending our conference show up for the keynote and opening. It’s important. You’ll listen to the presentations and take note of those you would like to attend. As you listen, you may be inspired to present a session yourself. There are no deadlines or time limits: simply step up and describe your idea for a session.

### Attending Sessions
At the end of the presentation, you will browse the notices on the Marketplace and sign up to attend any sessions that interest you. Signing up for a session is optional. You may attend any session you like and even move between sessions.

### Adding Sessions
You may add a session to the schedule at any time during the event by posting information about it in an available slot in the agenda. We’ll have periodic announcements of any new or rescheduled sessions, but it’s a good idea for all participants to keep an eye out for schedule changes as well.
