    Willem Larsen has been training software teams to master the skills of high performance and accelerated learning for a 
    decade. He is a developer at Hunter Industries, birthplace of Mob Programming, author of the Language Hunter’s Kit, 
    co-author of 5 Rules For Accelerated Learning, host of the yearly Thermodynamics of Emotion Symposium, founder of

  bio: |
    David Whitlock began his career as a software engineer hacking on the Java Virtual Machine. After realizing that the 
    challenges of leading people were just as exciting as crafting software that delights its users, he turned his attention 
    to working with others to help grow individuals and Teams within the context of a larger organization. He feels that 
    listening and communication are fundamental to understanding others and understanding yourself. By night, he is an 
    adjunct lecturer in the Computer Science Department at Portland State University. David likes watching things grown 
    whether they are Teams, companies, his students, his family, or the vegetables in his garden.

<h2 id="location">Location &amp; Map</h2>

Agile Open Northwest {{ page.year }} convenes at the [Leftbank Annex](http://leftbankannex.com/), a fabulous and funky former airplane-part machine shop turned event center.

A stone’s throw from the Pearl District, the Leftbank Annex is located one block east of the Leftbank Project and across the street from the Rose Garden. The Leftbank Annex is easily accessible by bus, MAX, and streetcar. The area is a major bicycle corridor and is easily accessible from every direction. A number of restaurants are within walking distance.

#### PARKING NOTICE

If you're from out of town and staying at the Crowne Plaza or anywhere in town, we hope you'll walk or take public transit to the Leftbank Annex. 

If you need to drive to the Leftbank Annex, limited paid parking is available at the Rose Quarter East Garage and at a nearby public lot. 
Parking for Wednesday and Friday will be $8 for the day. Please note that parking at the small Leftbank Annex lot is reserved for AONW volunteers, 
those needing reasonable accommodation, and Leftbank Annex staff. If you are unfamiliar with the Rose Quarter, please refer to 
this [printable map](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55b3f082e4b0addeebb1bf68/t/5667804ccbced62458a70f8c/1449623628670/LBA%2BParking%2BMap.pdf){:target="_blank"}
