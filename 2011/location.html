<p id="title">Conference Location</p>
		
<p>For Agile Open Northwest 2011, we’ll return to the Ambridge Event Center, a premier facility conveniently located in the heart of Portland's vibrant Lloyd District, the epicenter of The Rose City's special events. Grown in the tradition of hospitality for which the Northwest is famous, Ambridge Event Center takes its name and strength from a perfect, old-fashioned rose that thrives in Portland.

<p>The Ambridge Event Center is easily accessible by all of Portland’s metro area neighborhoods. Near the confluence of I-5 and I-84, it’s only blocks from the Oregon Convention Center and is served by the Max Red, Blue & Green lines, as well as Trimet Bus Route #6. We've reserved a number of rooms, all within close proximity of the agenda wall for easy reference. In addition to the meeting rooms, we'll have a dedicated space for registration, meals, breaks, and sponsor exhibits. In addition, there are numerous spots in the local area for impromptu gatherings. For your dinner choices, a number of restaurants are within walking distance.

<p>For out-of-towners, we have found a facility within walking distance of many hotels across the price range. Accommodations are available at several hotels close to the Ambridge Event Center, the nearby Convention Center, or in the Portland downtown area, a few short Max stops away in Fareless Square.
