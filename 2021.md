For a salary, she coaches agile thinking and self-management to software developers and keeps teams focused on continuous improvement, growth mindset, and general meta-cognition. At the moment she does this at Amazon. She's building a tiny house on the Olympic Peninsula using clay, straw, and sand. She dreams of someday starting a tiny arts foundation called Dionysus Giving. Because it amuses her, Michaela often claims to raise champion naked mole rats.

  bio: |
    I journeyed into technology via a music education. Working in the software industry since 2000, I’ve explored responsibilities of business analysis, project management, and people management. It was the agile values and principles that resonated strongest with me, and I have since focused on coaching agile development teams and championing individuals. I appreciate all the learning opportunities within our agile community of practice! I enjoy volunteering at AgilePDX, and now joining Agile Open Northwest. Additionally I am looking forward to further collaborate with Future of Work communities. I believe that people can change the world, and that we can achieve this by being curious, open, and kind.

    I hesitantly tweet at @sunhiltb.

<h2 id="location">Location &amp; Map</h2>

Created for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, Seattle Center calls itself "the nation's best gathering place." It certainly has a lot to offer, including cultural venues, sports arenas, entertainment options, the Science Center, and a Food Court, in addition to beautiful grounds. It is easily accessible by car, bus or riding the monorail from downtown Seattle.

This year we'll be in the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall, located at 299 Mercer Street and directly across from the convenient Seattle Center parking facility. There are numerous spots nearby for impromptu gatherings, including a McMenamin's pub for you Oregonians. For your dinner choices, a number of restaurants are within walking distance.

### Directions

The **Seattle Center Exhibition Hall** is in the same building as the Pacific Northwest Ballet, on the lower level:
