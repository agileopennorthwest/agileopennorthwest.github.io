- name: Michael Kelly

  bio: |
    Michael first encountered Agile (uppercase “A”) in 1998 in an IEEE Software Magazine article by Kent Beck about this thing called eXtreme Programming. It was a life transforming event. It wasn’t long before he was writing unit tests, organizing the work into “stories”, organizing the stories into “sprints”, estimating “points”, standing up, and retrospecting.

    But more than that, agile (lowercase “a”) became a guiding principle in his life. He used it in his relationships at work, the raising of his children, efforts to stay mentally and physically healthy, and the pursuit of marital bliss. His wife has occasionally complained that agile became the hammer for a world suddenly full of nails.

    Out of respect for his wife, he has tried to step outside his agile bias, knowing full well that all models attempting to explain the complex world around us are wrong. But despite his best efforts, he’s yet to find something better. He continues to see the world as a place full of nails for which agile (lowercase “a”) is the only rational hammer.

  bio: | 
    Michaela Hutfles is a sideways E-shaped person (rather than T) with three major depths: agile software development, earth-building and performing arts of all flavors. For a salary, they coach agile thinking and self-management to software developers and keep teams focused on continuous improvement, growth mindset, and general meta-cognition. At the moment they do this at Qumulo. They’re building a tiny house on the Olympic Peninsula using clay, straw, and sand. They dream of someday starting a tiny arts foundation called Dionysus Giving. Because it amuses them, Michaela often claims to raise champion naked mole rats.
- name: Nora Beyerle
  img: nora.jpeg
  bio: |
    I journeyed into technology via a music education. Working in the software industry since 2000, I’ve explored responsibilities of business analysis, project management, and people management. It was the agile values and principles that resonated strongest with me, and I have since focused on coaching agile development teams and championing individuals. I appreciate all the learning opportunities within our agile community of practice! I enjoy volunteering at AgilePDX, and now joining Agile Open Northwest. Additionally I am looking forward to further collaborate with Future of Work communities. I believe that people can change the world, and that we can achieve this by being curious, open, and kind.

Created for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, Seattle Center calls itself "the nation's best gathering place." It certainly has a lot to offer, including cultural venues, sports arenas, entertainment options, the Science Center, and a Food Court, in addition to beautiful grounds. It is easily accessible by car, bus or riding the monorail from downtown Seattle.

This year we'll be in the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall, located at 299 Mercer Street and directly across from the convenient Seattle Center parking facility. There are numerous spots nearby for impromptu gatherings, including a McMenamin's pub for you Oregonians. For your dinner choices, a number of restaurants are within walking distance.

### Directions

The **Seattle Center Exhibition Hall** is in the same building as the Pacific Northwest Ballet, on the lower level:
