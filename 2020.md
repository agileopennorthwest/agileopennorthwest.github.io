  bio: |
    Mary has filled a variety of roles in software development teams during her career. 
    She enjoys finding ways to bring efficiency and visibility to just about any process, using Agile methods even 
    before she knew what Agile was. Mary has been a Certified Scrum Master since 2013 and currently works for a 
    Seattle area financial services firm helping implementation teams build better relationships with their business 
    partners and deliver value in an iterative fashion. In her spare time, she brings her process improvement skills 
    to bear in her volunteer time with the Seattle Mountaineers, a local non-profit outdoor community.

  bio: |
    I love hearing what people want to do and helping them see the ways in which they might do it. In doing  the work, we discover the work that needs to be done.

    For the last decade that’s been my story: facilitator, trainer, coach, mentor, guide, storyteller, provocateur. Happiness for me is working with a team of people who are different from me; together, we serve others better than I could alone. Along the way, I've held all the software roles that begin with "p" and end with "manager." Twice I was a director at a growing startup. My early years were spent technically writing.

    I write things at [FeelingAgile.com](http://feelingagile.com). Still available on iTunes is the “The Agile Coach” podcast. @mjt on Twitter is me being short. Invite me and I'll talk, wherever and whenever you like. Agile Open Northwest’s annual Open Space brings me joy. And I find peace sailing the waters north of Seattle.

    April leads with empathy and courage while partnering with others to help unlock their full potential. She believes the 
    path to authentic growth and change begins with invitation and a people-centered approach. She favors a blended mindset of 
    agile, lean, design thinking, open space, and improvisation when engaging. April values connecting people to ownership of 
    their needs and goals. You may find April coaching organizations, speaking at conferences, facilitating social change as a 
    Design Action Lab partner, or mentoring youth.
